 * same across those plans. Measured on Surefire 3.5.6 with rerunFailingTestsCount=3 --
 * one test arrived as FAILED, FAILED, SUCCESSFUL across plans 1..3, and was absent from
 * plan 4 because Surefire narrows each re-run to what is still failing. This is unchanged
 * from 3.5.2; only the session scoping around it changed, in 3.5.4.
